						<h1>Mission <span>Statement </span></h1>
						<p>It is Drip Auto Care's mission to provide the convenience of service and excellent customer care to each customer. Dripâ€™s team understands the importance of having customers that are more than satisfied and strive to provide excellence in all we do. Drip is built on a foundation of integrity and love. We love our customers and we love providing our customers with convenient excellent service.</p>

						<p>Drip understands that life can get busy and that time is valuable. Knowing this we understand that having a clean car is important and time-consuming. Most of us spend just as much time in our cars as we do in our office; we understand that our cars should be clean and comfortable. Drip has come into this industry to provide what we felt was missing in the automobile care industry. We felt quality service and convenience should come at an affordable price while being as convenient as possible.</p>

						<p>That is why we started Drip to give our customers a convenient service by offering on-demand service and recurring scheduled appointments. Customers have flexibility in scheduling their appointments which can all be done online or through our app. In order to keep the prices affordable and our service convenient, all services are subscription-based. We have monthly, quarterly, biannual, and annual subscriptions. All subscriptions are paid upfront for the option chosen by customer and renewal is auto drafted from customer accounts approximately one week prior to the renewal date. </p>
